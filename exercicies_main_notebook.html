<h2>The convention we will use to create our program is to adopt
	 lowercase letters and not use accents and, of course, use the
	 extension .html.</h2>

<br>
Another important point is that every change maof to the 
.html file must be saved and, in addition, the browser needs to
 reload the page for the latest change to the file to take effect.
